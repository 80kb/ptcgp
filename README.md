# Pokemon TCG Player
#### A lightweight, automated Pokemon TCG client/game-engine aiming to be highly customizable and dynamic.

Every card is defined using a simple LUA plugin interface that allows users to implement new cards to the game quickly. Players can play any card from any generation of Pokemon TCG or custom-made cards.

This project is currently being reimplemented from https://github.com/80kb/ptcgp-c
